                                  BASIC SCANNNG TECHNIQUE:
1. nmap Target_IP(singgle IP Scan)
2. nmap Terget_1 Terget_2(Scan Multiple Target)
3. Nmap 192.168.1.0-100 or 192.168.1.0-254(Scan a range of IP)
4. Nmap 192.168.1.0/24(Scan Entire Subnet) 
5. Nmap -iL list.txt
6. Nmap 192.168.1.0/24 --exclude 192.168.1.112
                                  DISCOVERY OPTIONS:
1. Nmap -Pn 192.168.1.112 (Don't Ping)
2. Nmap -sP 192.168.1.112 (Ping Only Scan)
3. Nmap --traceroute demo.testfire.net
                                  ADVANCED SCANNING OPTIONS:

1. Nmap -sS 192.168.1.112 (TCP SYN Scan)
2. Nmap -sT 192.168.1.112 (TCP Connect Scan)
3. Nmap -sF 192.168.1.112 (TCP Fin Scan)
4. Nmap -sX 192.168.1.112 (Xass Scan)
                                PORT SCANNING OPTIONS
1. Nmap -F 192.168.1.112 (Fast Scan Only 100 Ports)
2. Nmap -p 80 192.168.1.112 (Scan Specific Ports)
                                OPERSTING SYSTEM OR SERVICE DETECTION:
1. Nmap -O 192.168.1.112(Operating System Detection)
2. Nmap -sV 192.168.1.112(Service Version Detection)
